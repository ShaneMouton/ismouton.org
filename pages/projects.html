  <h1>MooBox</h1><br>
  MooBox is an interface designed to bring retro games to your mobile devices.
  Since projects compiled with Emscripten had no interface for mobile devices,
  I set out to solve that with MooBox. With MooBox a developer can compile their project
  with Emscripten and easily include it with MooBox to make a mobile friendly version of
  their application! MooBox allows for the precision of an analog joystick or for digital
  controls. As a developer you can be assured all your games can be integrated with MooBox!

  <h1>spaceLife</h1><br>
  spaceLife is an implementation of Conway's Game Of Life implemented in JavaScript.
  Originally it was implemented in C and libSDL but later ported JavaScript. It is implemeneted
  using Typed Arrays. At one time it was one of the fastest implementations in JavaScript, but with
  the advent of faster algorithms this is no longer the case.

  <h1>Chip-8 Emulator</h1><br>
    <p>
      Chip-8 can be though of as an early interpretted language more akin to byte code than something like Python.
    </p>
    This Chip-8 Emulator was written with clean well documented code in mind. The virtual screen also
    is designed to emulated the monochromatic CRTs of the era.
